# 🚀 Adventure Works - Modern Analytics Stack

Welcome to the **Adventure Works - Modern Analytics Stack** project!  
This repository showcases a hands-on **Analytics Engineering** project designed to demonstrate the development and deployment of a **modern data platform**, aligned with the **Modern Analytics Stack** methodology.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **💠 dbt (data build tool)**: For SQL-based transformations, modular data modeling, and automated testing.  
- **❄️ Snowflake**: Cloud data warehouse used to store and query structured data.  
- **📊 Power BI**: Business intelligence tool for data visualization and interactive dashboards.  

---

## 📌 Project Goals

This project aims to demonstrate:

- How to build a transformation pipeline using **dbt**.  
- How to centralize and query data using **Snowflake**.  
- How to build insightful dashboards using **Power BI**.  
- Best practices for organizing, documenting, and version-controlling data projects.  

---

## 🔄 Data Pipeline

1. **Raw Data Load**: Adventure Works datasets are ingested into Snowflake.  
2. **Data Modeling with dbt**: Models are organized into `staging`, `intermediate`, and `mart` layers.  
3. **Visualization**: Power BI connects directly to Snowflake to create dynamic, insight-driven dashboards.
